## SocialTen - App Overview for Product Discussion

### App Concept
**SocialTen** is a minimalist social media app designed to make people "real again." The core concept is simple: users rate their day on a scale of 1-10 and share authentic moments with a small, curated circle of friends. The app intentionally limits connections to a maximum of 10 friends, emphasizing quality over quantity in social interactions.

### Design Philosophy
- **Shadow Minimalism Aesthetic**: Dark mode only with a near-black background (#0A0A0F), subtle card backgrounds, and minimal use of color
- **Glow Customization**: Users can personalize their profile with customizable glow colors (cyan, purple, blue, green, orange, pink, white) and intensity levels that appear as subtle glows around their avatar and UI elements
- **Clean Typography**: Ultra-light and light weight fonts, extensive letter-spacing, lowercase text throughout for a calm, modern feel
- **Glass Card Effects**: Subtle card backgrounds with thin borders and soft shadows

### Key Intentional Limitations
1. **10 friend maximum** - Forces meaningful connections
2. **Camera only, no gallery** - Encourages authentic, in-the-moment sharing
3. **Square photos only** - Consistent aesthetic
4. **No video** - Keeps content simple and quick to consume
5. **Dark mode only** - Cohesive aesthetic, reduces screen time strain
6. **Simple reactions (+1 only)** - No emoji reactions, keeps interactions simple
7. **No public profiles/discovery** - Must search by username to add friends

---

### Technical Stack
- **Platform**: iOS (SwiftUI)
- **Architecture**: MVVM with @Observable
- **State Management**: Single AppViewModel managing all state
- **Data**: Currently in-memory with sample data (no backend yet)
- **Camera**: AVFoundation for custom camera implementation
- **Minimum iOS**: iOS 17+ (uses newer SwiftUI features)

### Features Discussed But Not Yet Implemented
1. **7-Day Rating History Chart** - Visual graph showing rating trends on profile
2. **Modular Profile Sections** - Drag-to-reorder, show/hide sections on profile
3. **Advanced Theme Customization** - Card styles, background styles, font choices
4. **Rating History for Friends** - See friends' 7-day trends when viewing their profile
